# LonelySim
## Hello, prisoner.

Welcome to LonelySim, an escape room-type game, but with a GUI.
LonelySim displays a variety of different user interfaces, some providing a clue
to help you exit the simulation, and others just because.

## What does each UI do?

There are four interfaces in LonelySim:
+ a chat app
+ a notes app
+ a links app
+ a contacts app

All of the apps except for the contacts app are functional, meaning you can interact with
them in meaningful ways. For example, if you choose for some reason to add a link
into the game, you can do that. This is actually one way of exiting the simulation,
but it isn't very fun. The links and notes are fully editable - you can add and remove them.
